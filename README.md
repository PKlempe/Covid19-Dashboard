# Covid19-Dashboard
> **Data Source:** COVID-19 Dataset by Our World in Data - https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data

This basic Covid dashboard has been developed for the course "VIS - Visualisation and Visual Data Analysis" at the University of Vienna. The goal of this assignment was to implement a web-based dashboard based on a low-fidelity design prototype created in a previous assignment.

The website in general has been built by using the JavaScript Framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the state management pattern + library [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/). All the visualizations shown have been created from scratch by using the visualization library [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3).

**Note:** Due to timely reasons, the dashboard hasn't been completely finished. Initially planned things like tooltips when hovering bars/lines or a matrix view for the location stats are sadly missing. This is the exact state of the project from the time when I submitted it for grading.
